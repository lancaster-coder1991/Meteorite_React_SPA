# Meteorite React App

This SPA uses React and calls to NASAâ€™s meteorite landing API to display a page where you can search for meteorite landings in a particular year and find them on a map using React-Leaflet. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run, clone the repository to a local directory. Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed and then navigate into the new directory and run the following command in a terminal to install the required dependencies:

`npm i`

Now in the project directory run:

`npm start`

This runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
